\title{Resolve a Model Specification for a Computational Engine}
\usage{
translate_celery(x, ...)

\method{translate_celery}{default}(x, engine = x$engine, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A model specification.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{engine}{The computational engine for the model (see \code{?set_engine_celery}).}
}
\description{
\code{translate_celery()} will translate_celery a model specification into a code
object that is specific to a particular engine (e.g. R package).
It translate_celerys generic parameters to their counterparts.
}
\details{
\code{translate_celery()} produces a \emph{template} call that lacks the specific
argument values (such as \code{data}, etc). These are filled in once
\code{fit()} is called with the specifics of the data for the model.
The call may also include \code{tune()} arguments if these are in
the specification. To handle the \code{tune()} arguments, you need to use the
\href{https://tune.tidymodels.org/}{tune package}. For more information
see \url{https://www.tidymodels.org/start/tuning/}

It does contain the resolved argument names that are specific to
the model fitting function/engine.

This function can be useful when you need to understand how
\code{celery} goes from a generic model specific to a model fitting
function.

\strong{Note}: this function is used internally and users should only use it
to understand what the underlying syntax would be. It should not be used
to modify the model specification.
