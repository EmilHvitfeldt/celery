    These cluster specification fucntion are used to specify the type of model
    you want to do. These functions work in a similar fashion to the [model
    specification function from parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html#models).

    These Functions are the generics are are supported for specifications
    created with tidyclust.

- title: Prediction
  desc: >
    Once the cluster specification have been fit, you are likely to want to look
    at where the clusters are and which observations are associated with which
    cluster.
  contents:
    - predict.cluster_fit
    - extract_cluster_assignment
    - extract_centroids
- title: Model based performance metrics
  desc: >
    These metrics use the fitted clustering model to extract values denoting how
    well the model works.
