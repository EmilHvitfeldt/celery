- title: Specifications
  desc: >
    These cluster specification fucntion are used to specify the type of model
    you want to do. These functions work in a similar fashion to the [model
    specification function from parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html#models).
  contents:
    - k_means
- title: Fit and Inspect
  desc: >
    These Functions are the generics are are supported for specifications
    created with tidyclust.
  contents:
    - fit.cluster_spec
    - augment.cluster_fit
    - glance.cluster_fit
    - tidy.cluster_fit
- title: Prediction
  desc: >
    Once the cluster specification have been fit, you are likely to want to look
    at where the clusters are and which observations are associated with which
    cluster.
  contents:
    - predict.cluster_fit
    - extract_cluster_assignment
    - extract_centroids
- title: Parameter Objects
  desc: >
    Parameter objects for tuning. Similar to
    [parameter objects from dials package](https://dials.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html#parameter-objects)
  contents:
    - num_clusters
- title: Model based performance metrics
  desc: >
    These metrics use the fitted clustering model to extract values denoting how
    well the model works.

    - cluster_metric_set
    - avg_silhouette
    - tot_sse
    - sse_ratio
    - tot_wss
- title: Tuning
  desc: >
    Functions to allow multiple cluster specifications to be fit at once.
